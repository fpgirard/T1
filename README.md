# Aqara T1 Valve Controller Mount

The [Aqara T1 Valve Controller](https://us.aqara.com/products/valve-controller-t1?srsltid=AfmBOoqY8_ugod5owPfjZAhMKLAppVGNp1EPUJe-erywH94czYdjkrGF) is an affordable motorized water shutoff valve whose [mounting bracket](https://us.aqara.com/cdn/shop/files/AqaraValveControllerT1_20.webp?v=1732710054&width=1200) is widely regarded as its weakest component. [Many Amazon reviewers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2XOU6VDMNO59K/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8) cite the included bracket as the device’s Achilles heel, while [users in the Reddit r/Aqara community](https://www.reddit.com/r/Aqara/comments/1lyy8m7/any_tips_on_securing_the_t1_valve_controller/) as well as [Aqara forums](https://forum.aqara.com/t/aqara-water-valve-t1-mounting-brackets/63853/2) frequently discuss the need for a more robust mount design. Details regarding the T1 can be found [here](https://smarthomescene.com/reviews/aqara-t1-water-gas-valve-controller-review/).

The [Tuya Valve Control](https://www.amazon.com/Motorized-Watering-Electric-Controller-Automatically/dp/B0851DYWBH) has a mount that is eerily similar to the Aqara. Buyers report that this product has a solid design with the exception of the metal mounting bracket. Why not create a mount that can be used for both products? [I did](doc/tuya.png).  Next might be the [Dome Water Main Shut-Off valve](https://www.wink.com/products/leak-protection-kit/) which appears to have the same body bracket.  There's a series of comments about the Dome and similar products [suffer the same mount concerns as the Aqara and Tuya](https://community.smartthings.com/t/whats-the-consensus-on-water-valves/87777/7).

Rigorous tests for both using a Home Assistant script that opens and closes these valves at random intervals between 1 and 3 minutes would be a logical next step.  Let's see which one dies first.  Perhaps I should add the Bulldog to the mix?

This project provides the Aqara and Tuya controllers with a sturdy mount that:

1. Attaches to the valve body and not the pipe.  This is consistent with [plumbing best practices](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61tk9mOD39L._AC_SL1200_.jpg).  
2. Incorporates a C-clamp design that mitigates twisting during operation.  This is even more foolproof and customizable than the one offered on [the EcoNet Bulldog](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61tk9mOD39L._AC_SL1200_.jpg).    
3. Fits a [large variety of valves](doc/valves.jpg). 
4. Brings the Zigbee-based Aqara and Tuya controllers on par with the Z-Wave-based [EcoNet Bulldog](https://www.amazon.com/EcoNet-Controls-EVC200-HCSML-Friendly-Plumbing/dp/B07DJZCFBH) at one-third the price.

This repository has the following directories:

[<code>src</code>](https://github.com/fpgirard/Aqara-Tuya/tree/main/src) has OpenSCAD source for the T1 mount and HA test scripts for 100 on/off tests  
[<code>stl</code>](https://github.com/fpgirard/Aqara-Tuya/tree/main/stl) contains various .stl files for different valve bodies for both the Aqara and Tuya controllers   
[<code>doc</code>](https://github.com/fpgirard/Aqara-Tuya/tree/main/doc) has installation instructions and other supporting documents (images).

Current valves supported for this project are the Sharkbite 3/4" valves (old and new) but if [we follow EcoNet](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0929/0448/9329/files/Alternate-Kits-01_1.jpg), the following alternate mounting brackets might be next:

* HC2XXL Mounting Kit for Large Valves
* 3/4” Propress Mounting Kit for ¾” Propress Valves
* 1” Propress Mounting Kit for 1” Propress Valves
* 1-1/4” Propress Mounting Kit for 1-1/4” Propress Valves
* 1-1/2” Propress Mounting Kit for 1-1/2” Propress Valves
* HC3PEX0.5 Mounting Kit for Pex B 1/2" Tab Ring Valves
* HC3PEX0.75 Mounting Kit for Pex B 3/4" Tab Ring Valves
